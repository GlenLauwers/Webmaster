			<p> see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. 
			How it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft encounters 
			a black hole does the computer call it an 'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't know, that means we never 
			told anyone. And if we never told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.

			<p> lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island. 
			Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine. 
			Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll slip into a coma and die.

			<p>, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. 
			Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if 
			they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. 
			She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

		<h4>Hello Aptana!</h4>
			<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my 
			name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical 
			helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. 
			And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
			Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. 
			You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. 
			we swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, 
			you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.
